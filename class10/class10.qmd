```{r}
stats = read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
stats
```
```{r}
rn.comma = function(x){
  
  as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x) )
}
```


```{r}

pdbstats = apply(stats, 2, rn.comma)
pdbstats

```



Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
xray = sum(pdbstats[,1])
em = sum(pdbstats[,2])
total = sum(pdbstats[,7])

(xray + em) / total
```


Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?


```{r}
proteins = sum(pdbstats[1, 7])
proteins / total
```


Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

SKIPPED!

```{r}
library(readr)
```



Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Hydrogen is too small for the current resolution, so only the oxygen is shown.


Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH 308

Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

Here is the figure

## The bio3d package for structural bioinformatics

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb = read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

# Predicting functional motions of a single structure

Let's finish today with a bioinformatics calculation to predict the functional motinos of a PDB structure

```{r}
adk = read.pdb("6s36")
m = nma(adk)
```


```{r}
plot(m)
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
